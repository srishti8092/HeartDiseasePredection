# HeartDiseasePredection

## Purpose
The project Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning is developed to overcome heart disease in earlier stages. The Project "Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning" is implemented using python completely. Here first the user needs to register into the system in order to use the prediction, user needs to register with username, email-id, phone, age and password. All these values are stored into the file system respectively, then user has option to move forward or leave, then user needs to login to the system using the username and password which he/she provided during the time of registration. If he/she enter incorrect username and correct password then the error message will prompt stating incorrect username and if he/she enters incorrect password and correct username then the error message will prompt stating incorrect password, so both username and password is necessary in order to login to the system. After logging in the user needs to the name and needs to select the symptoms from given drop-down menu, for more accurate result the user needs to enter all the given symptoms, then the system will provide the accurate result. This prediction is basically done with the help of 5 algorithms of machine learning 
## Frontend Implementation
The application developed is named “DIAGNOSE IT”. The name diagnose it suggests that one can diagnose and predict their disease if any. This application diagnoses whether a person has a CVD or not. This application is user friendly and is of very easy to use.
Basically it contains of pages, namely: 
a.	Landing Page 
b.	Login Page 
c.	SignUp Page 
d.	Form Page 
e.	Result Page (in process) 

## Backend Implementation
We have used Python language for prediction of occurrence of heart disease. We have used five different algorithm and came to a conclusion that voting classifier and Logistic regression methods gives the highest accuracy. Further implementation is going on for linking the entered data by user in the application with the test data of the machine learning. 
o	Random Forest Algorithm 
o k Nearest Neighbour Algorithm 
o Logistic Regression Algorithm 
o Naive Bayes Algorithm 
o	Voting Classifier Algorithm
